The Final Thought: School Doesn\u2019t Decide Your Future\u2014You Do**\n\nMost people let school shape their minds, their future, and their self-worth. But you don\u2019t have to.\n\nYou have two choices:  \n1\ufe0f\u20e3 **Be another person stuck in the system, competing for grades and approval.**  \n2\ufe0f\u20e3 **Use the system while building your own path to greatness.**\n\n**Which one will you choose?** \ud83d\ude80"
